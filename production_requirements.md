# Production Requirements for Benchmarking Harness

This document outlines the key areas to consider when defining production requirements for the benchmarking harness.

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

- **Target Uptime:** What is the target uptime for the benchmarking harness (e.g., 99.9%, 99.99%)? This will influence design choices for redundancy and failover.
- **Latency Ranges:**
    - What is the acceptable latency for submitting a new benchmark job?
    - What is the acceptable latency for retrieving the status of an ongoing benchmark?
    - What is the acceptable latency for viewing detailed benchmark results?
    - What is the acceptable latency for searching/filtering past benchmark results?
- **Expected Throughput:**
    - How many benchmarks can be expected to run concurrently?
    - What is the anticipated number of API requests per second (RPS) to the system (e.g., for submitting jobs, checking status, fetching results)?
    - What is the expected data ingestion rate for benchmark metrics?

## Target Users & Workload

- **Primary Users:**
    - Who are the primary users of this system (e.g., internal research scientists, ML engineers, external developers contributing models, automated CI/CD systems)?
    - Understanding the user base helps tailor the interface and prioritize features.
- **Number of Users:**
    - What is the estimated number of active users (daily, weekly, monthly)?
    - How many concurrent users are expected during peak times?
- **Anticipated Usage Pattern:**
    - Will users primarily run frequent, small, iterative tests?
    - Or will the system be used for infrequent, large-scale benchmarking runs?
    - Will there be a mix of both? Understanding this helps optimize for common workflows.
- **Peak Load Times:**
    - When are the peak load times expected (e.g., end of development sprints, before major releases, during specific automated nightly/weekly runs)?
    - Are there specific events or deadlines that might cause usage spikes?

## Security and Compliance

- **Data Sensitivity:**
    - What is the sensitivity level of the benchmark data (e.g., model architectures, hyperparameters, performance metrics)?
    - What is the sensitivity level of the benchmark results (e.g., comparative performance, potential vulnerabilities discovered through benchmarking)?
    - Are there any proprietary datasets or models involved that require special handling?
- **Compliance Standards:**
    - Are there any specific industry or regulatory compliance standards that the system must adhere to (e.g., GDPR for personal data if user information is stored, HIPAA if health-related data is involved, SOC2 for service organizations)?
    - This will heavily influence data handling, auditing, and security controls.
- **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - How will users be authenticated (e.g., SSO, OAuth, API keys)?
    - What are the different roles and access levels required (e.g., admin, user, read-only)?
    - How will authorization be enforced for accessing specific benchmarks, results, or administrative functions?
- **Data Retention Policies:**
    - How long does benchmark data and associated results need to be stored?
    - Are there legal or compliance requirements dictating retention periods?
    - What is the process for data archival and/or secure deletion?

## Scalability and Future Growth

- **Anticipated Growth:**
    - What is the expected growth in the volume of benchmark data (e.g., metrics, logs, artifacts) over the next 1-3 years?
    - What is the expected growth in the number of users and benchmark execution requests over the next 1-3 years?
    - How will the system scale to handle this growth (e.g., horizontal scaling of services, database sharding)?
- **Support for New Models/Datasets:**
    - Are there plans to support new types of models (e.g., different ML frameworks, larger architectures) in the future?
    - Are there plans to incorporate new or larger datasets for benchmarking?
    - How easily can the system be extended to accommodate these new requirements?

## Maintainability and Operability

- **Responsibility:**
    - Which team or individuals will be responsible for the ongoing maintenance, operation, and support of the benchmarking harness?
    - What are their skill sets and availability?
- **Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting:**
    - What key metrics need to be monitored to ensure system health and performance (e.g., error rates, latency, resource utilization, queue lengths)?
    - What level of logging is required for debugging, auditing, and performance analysis?
    - What conditions should trigger alerts to the operations team (e.g., SLO violations, system failures, security events)?
    - What tools will be used for monitoring, logging aggregation, and alerting?
- **Updates and Patches:**
    - What is the process for deploying updates to the benchmarking harness software?
    - How will patches for underlying infrastructure or dependencies be handled?
    - Is there a requirement for zero-downtime deployments?
    - How frequently are updates expected?

This document should serve as a starting point for discussions and decisions regarding the production deployment of the benchmarking harness. It should be reviewed and updated as requirements evolve.
